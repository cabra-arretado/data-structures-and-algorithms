# TypeScript

Using [Bun](https://bun.sh) instead of Node.js, since it treat TS as a 'first-class citizen' (I can execute directly from TS files).
For TS in order to get a better experience this just simulates Data Structures and Algorithms, since an actual implementation would be more faithful in a lower level language.

## To test
Run ```bun test```
